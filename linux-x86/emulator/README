This directory contains prebuilt emulator binaries that were generated by
running the following command on a 64-bit Linux machine:

  external/qemu/distrib/package-release.sh \
      --darwin-ssh=<host> \
      --copy-prebuilts=<path>

Where <host> is the host name of a Darwin machine, and <path> is the root
path of this AOSP repo workspace.
